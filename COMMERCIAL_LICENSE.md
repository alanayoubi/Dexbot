# Dexbot Commercial License

This repository is dual-licensed:
- Open-source license: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (`LICENSE`)
- Commercial license: available directly from the copyright holder

## Why this exists

Some teams need to use Dexbot without AGPL copyleft obligations (for example, proprietary redistribution or closed-source hosted offerings).  
For those cases, a separate commercial license is available.

## Commercial rights (by agreement)

A commercial agreement may grant rights such as:
- proprietary redistribution
- closed-source modifications
- embedding Dexbot in paid products/services
- commercial support/SLA terms

Rights are only granted when explicitly stated in a signed commercial agreement.

## No automatic commercial grant

Using this file alone does not grant commercial rights.  
If you do not have a signed commercial agreement, your use defaults to AGPL-3.0.

## Contact

To request commercial licensing terms, contact the maintainer via:
- GitHub issues/discussions in this repository, or
- the contact channel listed in the repository profile.
